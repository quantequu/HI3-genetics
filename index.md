Here I will attempt to explain the genes of HI3 to you ina  way that is hopefully helpful and mildly entartaining. I don’t like being too serious. To begin I will go over the basic idea of the genetics, then focus on the genes as they appear and are treated in HI3, and then end with some of my own commentary on the broader equine genetics topic.

For a brief intro of genes, there are many different genes that horses can have, and each one has a different effect on the color of the horse. Each gene has two alleles, which can be thought of as each gene having two parts that work together to have an effect on the coat. It’s like each gene is a small color project where you can have up to two people working on it at the same time. You might only have one person on the project, and possibly even no one at all working on a particular color project. The different projects, and the number of people working on each project, combine together for a final horse color.

#What in tarnation are alleles?
I’ll explain by an example. Take humans. Humans ahev hair colors. Say you have brown hair like me. You probably learned in high school about punnet squares and all that. Say we ridiculousl restrict possible hair colors to blonde and brown, and say that brown hair color is ‘stronger’ than blonde. The gene for hair color has two slots. We will reresent brown hair by B and blonde hair by b. each slot for hair color can have either B or b, because those are our only two possibilities. So here are the ways you can fill in the slot for hair color: BB, Bb, bB, and bb. As it turns out, Bb and bB are exactly the same, just the order is different, but the order doesn’t matter. I personally thing Bb look snicer than bB, but again, it doesn’t matter.
Back to the ahir color. I said that Brown, B was stronger than blonde, b, which is why I gave brown the capital letter. Capital letters are stronger than lowerase letters. Lets start easy. If I fill in the two slots with BB, then brown hair is the only color there, so the person will have brown hair. Likewise, if I fill in the slots with bb, blonde hair is the only on there, and so the person will have blonde hair.
What happens with Bb? Well, uppercase letters are stronger, so the uppercase if going to take over the show and push the lowercase to the figuratuve side. So in Bb, B will show and we said that was brown hair. With Bb, the person will have brown hair even tough they have a slot with blonde hair, b just isnt strong enough to show up. 
This is how horse color genes work. There are different genes, each with two slots, each slot filled by an allele, and depending on how those slots are filled, you get different colors. Some genes are easier to understand than others, it’s true. Each slot is called, formally, and allele. Ther are uppercase and lowercase alleles. Uppecase, or dominant, alleles push lowercase, or recessive alleles, to the side and tak eover that gene. It’s not always that simple but in general this is how it goes, uppercase vs lowercase.

It turns out, however, that there are two types of dominat alleles: compelte and incomplete dominant.

A dominant allele is uppercase, a strong man. 
A complete dominant is an uppercases allele where, amazingly, one copy is just as good as two copies. Like with the brown hair and blonde hair, BB and Bb both showed the same color of brown hair, so in that case, B was a complete dominant allele. It didn’t matter if there were one or two copies of B present.
An incomplete dominant allele is a bit different. It’s still uppercase, but one copy is not as good as two copies. In the hair example, if B were instead an incomplete dominant, Bb would show as a dirty blonde or perhaps a light brown, while BB would be a full brown color. Bb is not as strong as BB is for making hair be brown, and so the effect of B is not as strong in the case of Bb, while in BB it is fully strong.
A recessive gene is like b, where it needs to the only allele on stage to be seen, ie, the gene needs to be bb with no dominant present. You might be questioning: in the case of incomplete dominant Bb, b did seem to have an effect? This is not the right way to think about it. For the incomplete dominant, it was not the presence of b that make the color a light brown instead of a full brown, but the lack of BB, the lack of two copies of B, that caused this mid-color to appear. Little b is still completely inferior to B.

**What does a horse color gene stuff look like?**
Most excellent question. Here I will already have to diverge from the representation in HI3, because I cant think of a good way to explain this without a bit of different notation. In the game, if a horse’s genes are tested, you get a full report of every possible gene tht can be tested and the result, even if for most genes there is no effet because there isnt really a copy of the gene present. I am not going to use that entire list every time I want to express a color. Ther eis a common way outisde of HI3 of listing relevant genes that is rather succint. Here’s an example:
Ee/AA/cC/stySty/ToTo
Thaat means nothing to you and that’s fine. In the HI3 list, there are twenty some-odd genes in the full list. Here I am saying there are only 5 genes that actually have a wokring effect on the horse color, without showing all of the others that would be listed but essentially are not present. In tis shorter notation, I don tbother listing a bunch of recessive, noninteracting genes. For example, in this geno, as I will call it, there is not the gene for gray, G. This horse does not have gray. In the list, a horse without gray would have gg as its genetic component for the gray gene, but gg efective means this horse doesn thave gray at all, and so I don’t care about listing the gray gene in the geno above. Likewise, this horse does not have the dun  gene either, and so I don’t include two null copies. 

I just usde the term null. Perhaps hthis is where the frustration ebgins, if you are not already. I have spoken of uppercase and lowercase letters. Let us go back to the brown and blonde hair case. Let me complicate this example further. We have brown B, and blonde b. Let’s add another gene, red R. Say red is a complete dominant, so RR and Rr have the same effect. But wait, I have not told you what little r is. Little b is for blonde, but what about little r?
Little r is nothing. Little r has no effect on anyting at all. If a person has rr, they might aas well not even have that gene listed at all. But bb is not the same; bb s definitely a color, and that color is blonde. But hey’re both lowercase! The difference is this: b is a recessive allele, and r is a null allele. This will appear a few times in our genetic journey. I am choosing to call lowercase alleles that do cause some effect as recessive, and lowercase that serve no effect at all null. I will attempt to explain this further by coping the same geno from above:
Ee/AA/cC/stySty/ToTo
In this geno, and you ahev not learned this yet, but I will tell you to juste beliee me, that e is a recessive ellele, and and c and sty are null alleles. In other places, null alleles are replaced by ‘n’, so that the same geno would be written as 
Ee/AA/nC/nSty/ToTo
The lowercase allele e serves a color purpose, and so it stays as e, but lowercase c and sty are just a complete absence of an allele in that spot, and so that are null and could, in this other notation, be replaced by n.
In most cases, lowercase alleles are in fact null and serve no purpose. Sometimes they do serve a purpose and are recessive. 
The assignment of the term null is my own work and I do not expect you to see this anywhere else, but I am trying to translate how HI3 genetics appear in-game and I believe this to be a satisfactory method.

We are close to looking at our first gene! But a quite postponement to explain how I will list the headers. Below the bold header, I will tell you immediately if the gene is a  complete or incomplete dominant, or purely recessive in nature (and there ar ea few that are only recessive). In the bold header, I will list all the possible combintations of alleles that are either dominant or recessive. This means, if the lowercase letter would be null, I will not list that lowercase in the header because we really don’t care about null alleles – we have enough on our plate as it is. 

Of course there are caveats and outta-left-field genes that don’ play by the rules of everyone else, but for now I think I have given you enough of a foundation to begin with the first few major genes.

but hopefully by the end of this page you will be able to scroll back up here and read the color off like a pro. Maybe struggle a bit, and that’s absolutely fine.
I want to gripe a bit about the genes in the game, but I also want to acknowledge that he developers have done an amazing job with incoperating ral genetics into the game, with so many color variations and possibilities. O am truly impressed with their work and an so happy to have a game like this that makes me hoard so many horses for their looks. I do not want to understate my appreciation for what they have done.
But I do want to gripe.
Perhaps this means nothing to you now, but as you go through this guide I hope that you find some horses in agam ethat have their genetics tesed (usually high quality stallion at stud are a fairly easy way to find such horses) and look at tehir gene report. 
The report is an unorganized mess. 
The ‘order’ of genes you see means nothigna t al. I don’t know how they ended up at tthat ordering scheme but it is a travesty. I will present this guide in a sensible order, an order that at leastin the beginning is common for all other applications of equine color gee=netics, all other places outside of Horse Isle 3, and I do hope they sort that poor list out. It gives me a headache to look at it and it cannot possible tbo of any advantage ot anyone, especially to you, who I assume are trying to undersant such tings for the (close to?) first time, or perhaps you are a genetic veteran just browsing to see what yet another genetic guide has to say. But especially to you new budding geneticists, that list is miserable, and yet you mus tlook at it and use it and understand it.
Alrighty.
Let’s do this. 

Here is a screenshot of e gene test report. I don’t ecpect you to understand any of it, and the list itelf is diorganized. See 

**Extension (“black”) – EE, Ee, ee**
*Complete dominant (mostly)*
Extension is the most basic gene in horse colors. Its dominant allele E is responsible for black coats and is a complete dominant, and its recessive allele e is responsible for chestnut coats. Some may refer to this extension gene as the ‘red factor’ gene, red essentially referring to chestnut. Since extension is (usually, and I will go into this more shortly, but for now, it is a complete dominant) a complete dominant, EE and Ee both cause black coats, and the only way to have a chestnut coat is to have two recessive copies, ee. I called e recessive because e does do something, and the thing ee does is make a chestnut. So ee is important and not a null allele.
This is why on very rare occasion, Friesian horses can be born chestnut – if both parents happen to be black but heterozygous, meaning the two alleles are not identical in their upper or lowercase status, Ee and Ee, there is a chance that the foal can be ee and thus chestnut, despite both parents being visually black. Consequently, if a breed starts with only chestnut base horses, a black horse can never appear from an only chestnut line (black forest horses, for example), because ee and ee bred together will never produce a random capital E.

Your first gene is done! Hopefully that wasn’t too bad. 

**Agouti (“bay”) – AA, Aa**
*Complete dominant*
I will go ahead and tell you that Agouti is more complicated than I have led you to believe in the heading. For now, I will tell you about the basic A allele, but there are in act two additional ones.
Also note, from the heading, that I have not included aa. Remember what this means? This means that aa does nothing to a horse coat, and so a in null in nature.
Agouti is responisble for making bay horses. This requires a black base. In effect, Agouti restricts a black horse’s pigment to only exist on the lower legs, and often dark skin will show from under the bay hair around the eyes and muzzle as well. The mane and tail also remain black, as you have probably noticed. As such, Agouti on a chestnut base does absolutely nothing, since there is no black pigment to begin with. White agouti on chestnut does nothing visually, it is still important to genetics, as I explain below.
This leads to the interesting result that if you breed a black horse, E_/aa, with a  chestnut hore that could have ee/A_, it is possible to produce a bay foal – the dominant extension from the black parnet and a dominant agouti from the chestnut (though, again, ther eis no visual sign that the chestnut carried a dominant agouti allele o begin with).
The othe two variation sof Agouti I will leave until later on.
Horsehoes! I have done something I have not explained yet. I wrote E_/aa and ee/A_, utilizing those underscores (this is a common practice). Why the underscores? The underscores indicate that it doesn’t matter what the other allele is for that gene. For the first geno, Extension is a complete dominant, so EE and Ee have the same functional effect on the color, and so I don’t care if the second allele is E or e. I don’t want to have to chose one combination of parents and accidentally lead you to believe that only EE/aa and aa/AA can produce a bay, because Ee/aa and ee/Aa could as well, and so could EE/aa and ee/Aa, abd Ee/aa and ee/AA. But I also don’t want to write out all four combinations every time. So instead, I employ the underscore, so that you can focus better on the important bits, that the first geno was black, and the second geno was chestnut carrying at least one Agouti.

**Brown – EE/A_**
*Special case*
Here is the part where I explaint the ‘mostly compelte dominant extensioni bit. The term Brown describes a specific base set – that is, two dominant extension copies, and at least one Agouti copy on top. Brown horses will look like dark bay, but usually not as reddish in color – more of a muddy brown than a reddish brown. The alleles themselves are not special – it’s the same E and A from above, but the paricular combination is what makes the color specially brown instead of bay.
This means that a brown horse will never produce a chestnut foal. A brown horse must have two dominant Extension copies, EE, so for Extension, it must pass down a dominant copy, regardless of the other parent. A foal with at least one E cannot be chestnut.

I will make a note that I have personally had a ‘brown’ horse throw a chestnut foal. ‘Brown’ might occassional refer to a certain shade of color, much like I said it resembled a dark bay. Dark is not a color itself, but refers to the shade of bay that makes a visual brown. Confusing things like this will continue to arise.
From now on I will include Brown with Bay unless there is a real need to distinguish the two. Just remember that Brown is darker and muddier of a color than Bay, but overall they’re similar enough. 

GENECHECK: 
EE/aa = ?
Ee/Aa =
EE/AA =
ee/Aa =

Alright! First two genes are down. I want to mention quickly that Extension and Agouti are thought of as the base genes of equine color. This means that black, bay, and chestnut are the base colors, the foudantion on which every other gene acts on. And I suppose I have to recant slightly here. I told you aa is null, and that is true, but because agouti is a base/foundation gene, a black horse’s geno should still be written out as E_/aa, with the aa included. Agouti is just that important. This is the only null case in which I say this for, though. 

But now we move on to the dilute genes, which do indeed have the effect of diluting the color of a horse’s coat. They lighten it, sometimes even make it shinier. These are fun genes with fun effects. I attempt to list them in order of common-ness, as we go over the most common genes first,a dn the least common genes toward the end of each section.
